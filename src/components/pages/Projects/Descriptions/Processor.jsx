I was part of the development of a processor featuring a 16-bit architecture and 8 registers. The processor is capable of executing various instructions like mov, movt, add, sub, ldr, str, and b, among others. <br/><br/>

 To debug the Verilog code, I employed an FSM timing diagram from ModelSim. I modified the ALU to implement instructions such as add, sub, and and. Tools like DESim were used to test the processor, which implements a word-matching game. A demonstration of this program is available through the demo link below. Code sharing is restricted due to academic integrity, but it can be provided upon request. <br/><br/>
