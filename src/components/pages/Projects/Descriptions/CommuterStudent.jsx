     I had the privilege of contributing to the official website of the Skule Commuter Student Directorship within the University of Toronto Engineering Society. Collaborating with another webmaster, I improved my skills in Git workflows.<br/><br/>

     The Skule Commuter Students website, like this portfolio, is designed responsively for a range of devices, from mobile phones to wide monitors. We utilized Redux for managing the global state of the side navigation bar. Engaging with the Director and fellow team members was invaluable, as we incorporated their input to enhance the website. <br/><br/>
