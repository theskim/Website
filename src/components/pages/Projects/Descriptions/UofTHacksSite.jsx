      This is the official website and dashboard for UofTHacks X, the annual hackathon hosted by the University of Toronto. 
       Over 500+ students with a range of experience levels participated in the event. 
       I was responsible for working on the main site and creating the sign-in page for applicants and authentication.
        In order to complete this task, I had to work closely with the backend team to ensure that the data from my page was properly validated.<br/><br/>
