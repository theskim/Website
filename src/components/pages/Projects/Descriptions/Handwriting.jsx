            The project aimed to develop a deep-learning model capable of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to transform handwritten text into digital format. This technology has potential applications in various fields including education, healthcare, and business. This would not only aid in understanding lecture materials but also enhance note-taking across different languages.<br/><br/>

            Deep learning was chosen for its ability to process complex image data without the need for manual feature engineering. Unlike traditional methods, such as Hidden Markov Models, deep learning, particularly Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based architectures, can consider larger contextual information making it more effective for the sequential nature of handwritten text.<br/><br/>

            Existing technologies like Google Translate and Apple Pencil's handwriting recognition underscore the relevance of OCR. Our research also explored advanced techniques combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and RNNs to enhance feature extraction and sequence processing.<br/><br/>

            We utilized a combination of CNN for initial image processing and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) for sequence analysis, employing Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss for training the model. This architecture was selected to optimize both computational efficiency and performance.<br/><br/>

            The IAM Handwriting Database was used to create a balanced training dataset to prevent biases related to word length. We ensured a rigorous splitting protocol for training, validation, and testing to maintain integrity and reliability in model evaluation.<br/><br/>

            A ResNet152-based model served as our baseline to compare improvements. Our final model significantly outperformed the baseline (52% vs 29% test accuracy), demonstrating the effectiveness of our chosen architecture in handling real-world handwritten text.<br/><br/>

            The project not only met but exceeded initial expectations in terms of accuracy and application readiness, marking a significant step forward in the practical use of OCR technologies in diverse real-world scenarios.
