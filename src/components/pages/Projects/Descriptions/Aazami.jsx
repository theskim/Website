        >Aazami primarily records the last 10 seconds of audio, which can be replayed through the voice command “I forgot.” By furnishing an effortless and dependable memory recall system, Aazami aims to elevate the life quality of dementia patients and their families.<br/><br/>
Developing Aazami involved integrating hardware and software components, including Arduino and Adafruit's Neopixel for hardware, and Edge Impulse for machine learning. Our team initiated the process by recording voices to develop a dataset for “I forgot” voice detection, which was refined through iterative testing. I mainly focused on training the machine learning model, spending over 87 minutes on Edge Impulse, resulting in 98.7% accuracy.<br/><br/>
We subsequently generated Arduino code, optimized hardware performance, and built an amplifier circuit to enhance the device’s sound. The components were then unified into a functional and efficient product.
